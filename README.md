# cpu-scheduling-algorithm-srtf
A Process Scheduler schedules different processes to be assigned to the CPU based on particular scheduling algorithms. These algorithms are either non-preemptive or preemptive. Non-preemptive algorithms are designed so that once a process enters the running state, it cannot be preempted until it completes its allotted time, whereas the preemptive scheduling is based on priority where a scheduler may preempt a low priority running process anytime when a high priority process enters into a ready state.
